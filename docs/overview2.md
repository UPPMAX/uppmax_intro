# Overview

```{objectives}
- Let's recap and go a little deeper into the organization of SNIC/UPPMAX

```

**UPPMAX = UppMACS**
- [Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science](http://uppmax.uu.se)

    
## Organisational orienteering

- [VR/SRC](https://www.vr.se/english.html) and a consortium of universities funds [SNIC](http://www.snic.se) — the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing
- SNIC and Uppsala University fund [UPPMAX](http://uppmax.uu.se). — UU’s supercomputing centre.
- Compute and Storage is a unit of [NBIS](https://nbis.se/), the national bioinformatics support infrastructure and a SciLifeLab platform, and is hosted by UPPMAX.
    
## UPPMAX missions
- Mission for SNIC: to provide a quality high-performance computing environment nationally
  - General purpose
  - Data intensive
  - Sensitive data (human sequences)
- Mission for UU: to provide relevant services to Uppsala University
- Mission for NBIS/SciLifeLab: to provide the best possible environment for data-driven life science, especially bioinformatics

## UPPMAX systems

- Clusters
  - Rackham (general purpose)
    - Snowy
  - Bianca (sensitive)
    - Miarka (Scilifelab production)
- Storage
  - On-load directly connected to the clusters
  - Off-load for large data not needed for computation analysis anymore
- Cloud
  - Dis (region EAST-1)

## UPPMAX support staff

- System experts
  - Hardware and system
- Application experts
  - software and usage
  - compute and storage project allocations
  - user accounts

## The Application experts not dealing with allocation and accounts

- Transfer HPC competence
  - intro courses like this
- Transfer computational know-how within the respective fields
  - Physics, chemistry, bioinformatics, geoscience, coding
  - [About the application-experts](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/about-us/application-experts/)
- In other words:
  - installing software,
  - troubleshooting,
  - general advice,
  - possibly make jobs more efficient.
- Email support for any query: support@uppmax.uu.se or use [support form](https://supr.snic.se/support/)
  - “tickets” are distributed according to competence
