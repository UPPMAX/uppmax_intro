# Welcome!

UPPMAX application experts want to share their skills in a 4-day series of lectures. 
We will help you move from being a Linux novice to an UPPMAX expert. 
If you already have the fundamentals down, you are still sure to enjoy the tips and tricks in the later parts of the course. 
Hence we've made it possible to sign up only for the days that are interesting to you.

## Lesson material
- First day will be on this [github website](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro/overview.html)
  - This is a test!  
- All other days each topic has its own Module in [Studium/Canvas](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/67267)

- Links to the modules can be found in the sidebar to  the left and below.


## Questions

### Questions very much related to the present talk during the lessons 
- best posed directly by voice
- Online chat or raise hand

### Questions requiring more effort to explain or answer 
- Use the HackMD session below:

[https://hackmd.io/@dianai/uppmax-intro](https://hackmd.io/VN85GrBbTb22izq5856kVg?both)

- Questions that come up off-line can as well be put here!
- We will test this very soon!

- Breakout rooms may be opened for some sessions.


- Shellshare will be used in some cases
  - You don't need to install anything
  - just follow the posted link when the teacher is opening it.
  - However, it will only be available during our session
and limited to last, perhaps, 500 rows


## Example of arrangement for the "worst case"!
- HackMD
- ZOOM view
- shellshare
- your own terminal
