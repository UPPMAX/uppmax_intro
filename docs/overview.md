# Overview

**UPPMAX = UppMACS**
- [Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science](http://uppmax.uu.se)

## UPPMAX missions
- Mission for SNIC: to provide a quality high-performance computing environment at Uppsala University AND nationally
  - General purpose
  - Data intensive
  - Sensitive data (human sequences)

More details in the afternoon about Organisational orienteering!

    
## UPPMAX systems

- Clusters
  - Rackham (general purpose)
    - Snowy (Long runs and GPU:s)
  - Bianca (sensitive data)
    - Miarka (new for LifeScience)
- Storage
  - On-load directly connected to the clusters
  - Off-load for large data not needed for computation analysis anymore
- Cloud
  - Dis (region EAST-1)

## High Performance Computing â€” HPC
### What is a cluster?

- A network of computers, each computer working as a node.

- From small scale RaspberryPi cluster

- To supercomputers like Rackham.

- Each node contains several processor cores and RAM and a local disk called scratch.

- The user logs in to login nodes via Internet through ssh or Thinlinc.

  - Here the file management and lighter data analysis can be performed.

- The calculation nodes has to be used for intense computing.
