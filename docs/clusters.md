## Organisational orienteering

    VR/SRCLinks to an external site. and a consortium of universities funds SNICLinks to an external site. — the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing.
    SNIC and Uppsala University fund UPPMAXLinks to an external site. — UU’s supercomputing centre.
    Compute and Storage is a unit of NBISLinks to an external site., the national bioinformatics support infrastructure and a SciLifeLab platform, and is hosted by UPPMAX.
    
## UPPMAX missions

    Mission for SNIC: to provide a quality high-performance computing environment nationally
        General purpose
        Data intensive
        Sensitive data (human sequences)
    Mission for UU: to provide relevant services to Uppsala University
    Mission for NBIS/SciLifeLab: to provide the best possible environment for data-driven life science, especially bioinformatics

## UPPMAX systems

    Clusters
        Rackham (general purpose)
            Snowy
        Bianca (sensitive)
            Irma
            Miarka (new)
    Storage
        On-load directly connected to the clusters
        Off-load for large data not needed for computation analysis anymore
    Cloud
        Dis (region EAST-1)

## UPPMAX support staff

    System experts
        Hardware and system
    Application experts
        software and usage
        compute and storage project allocations
        user accounts

## The Application experts not dealing with allocation and accounts

    Transfer HPC competence
        intro courses like this
    Transfer computational know-how within the respective fields
        Physics, chemistry, bioinformatics, geoscience, coding

    In other words:
        installing software,
        troubleshooting,
        general advice,
        possibly make jobs more efficient.
    Email support for any query: support@uppmax.uu.se
        “tickets” are distributed according to competence

 


## Clusters


We have a number of compute clusters:

    Rackham, reserved for SNIC projects
    Snowy, reserved for SNIC projects
    Miarka, reserved for Scilifelab production
    Bianca, a part of SNIC-SENS
    UPPMAX Cloud, a part of SNIC Science Cloud

The storage systems we have provide a total volume of about 20 PB, the equivalent of nearly 15 billion 3.5-inch floppy disks or 40,000 years of 128-bit encoded music. Read more on the storage systems page.
